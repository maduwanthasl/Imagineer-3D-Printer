## Building Process

#### Planning and Design Phase
- Initially, I formulated a plan outlining the design and functionality goals for my DIY 3D printer.
- I created sketches and diagrams to visualize the layout and structure of the printer.

#### Component Selection and Acquisition
- I compiled a detailed list of components required for building the 3D printer, considering factors such as performance, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.
- After finalizing the component list, I proceeded to order the necessary parts from suppliers.

#### Frame Construction
- Using aluminum extrusion profiles, M5 screws, and M5 T-nuts, I constructed the frame of the 3D printer.
- To reinforce the frame structure, I utilized aluminum corner profiles and corner brackets, ensuring stability and durability.
