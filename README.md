## Building Process

#### Planning and Design Phase
- Initially, I formulated a plan outlining the design and functionality goals for my DIY 3D printer.
- I created sketches and diagrams to visualize the layout and structure of the printer.

#### Component Selection and Acquisition
- I compiled a detailed list of components required for building the 3D printer, considering factors such as performance, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.
- After finalizing the component list, I proceeded to order the necessary parts from suppliers.
  
#### Frame Construction

</p>
- Using aluminum extrusion profiles, M5 screws, and M5 T-nuts, I constructed the frame of the 3D printer.
- To reinforce the frame structure, I utilized aluminum corner profiles and corner brackets, ensuring stability and durability.

#### Attaching Motion Components
- I attached motor brackets to two Z-axis stepper motors and an X-axis motor, securing them to the frame.
- Linear rails were installed to support the X-axis motion, along with a hotend holder and other 3D-printed parts for assembly.
  
#### Adding Y-axis Motion
- Similar to the X-axis setup, I attached 8mm short linear bearings to the bed frame and installed them through the linear rail.
- Additionally, I added a Y-axis motor to drive motion along the Y-axis.

#### Assembling Electronic Components
- I installed the extruder motor and TWO TREES Dual Drive BMG Extruder onto the frame, securing them in place.
- The PTFE tube was connected to the extruder assembly to guide filament to the hotend.

#### Wiring
- Electrical wiring was carefully routed and connected to the stepper motors, endstops, extruder, display, thermistor, fans, and other electronic components according to the printer's wiring diagram.
- Each wire was meticulously routed to ensure proper organization and prevent interference with moving parts.
- Connections were secured using appropriate connectors, terminals, or soldering, ensuring reliable electrical connections throughout the printer.
- Before powering on the printer, a thorough inspection of all wiring connections was conducted to verify correctness and safety.

#### Firmware Installation
- For my DIY 3D printer, I utilized Marlin firmware version 2.1.2.1, which provides extensive customization options and compatibility with various printer configurations.
- Additionally, I explored firmware options from the BigTreeTech family, including SKR main board firmware, to evaluate alternative features and optimizations for my printer setup.
- After selecting the appropriate firmware, I flashed it onto the printer's microcontroller using the recommended flashing tool and procedure.
- As part of personalization, I added a custom boot screen to the firmware, reflecting the unique identity of my Imagineer 3D printer.
- Following firmware installation, I meticulously reviewed and adjusted configuration files to tailor settings to my specific hardware and preferences.
- Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure proper functionality and compatibility with the printer's components and features.

#### Calibration and Testing
- Following firmware installation, I meticulously reviewed and adjusted configuration files to tailor settings to my specific hardware and preferences.
- Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure proper functionality and compatibility with the printer's components and features.
- I calibrated the currents of the motor drivers to optimize performance and prevent overheating or skipping steps.
- Temperature calibration of the hotend was performed to ensure accurate and consistent extrusion temperatures for optimal print quality.
- Distance calibration of the X, Y, Z axes, and extruder motor was carried out to fine-tune motion accuracy and alignment.
